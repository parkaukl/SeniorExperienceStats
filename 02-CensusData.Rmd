When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidycensus)
library(tidyverse)
library(stargazer)
library(dplyr)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(rgdal)
library(grid)
library(gridExtra)
library(htmlTable)

#In this section, we will start to observe what the important variables are in the ACS

```
```{r}
variables <- load_variables(2016, "acs5", cache = TRUE)
distinctvariables<-variables %>%
  distinct(concept)

# Based on the overview of this, there are some variables that might be important

# SEX BY AGE BY EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT FOR THE POPULATION 18 YEARS AND OVER
