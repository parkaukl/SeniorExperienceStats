When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidycensus)
library(tidyverse)
library(stargazer)
library(dplyr)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(rgdal)
library(grid)
library(gridExtra)
library(htmlTable)

#In this section, we will start to observe what the important variables are in the ACS

```
```{r}
variables <- load_variables(2016, "acs5", cache = TRUE)
distinctvariables<-variables %>%
  distinct(concept)

# Based on the overview of this, there are some variables that might be important

# SEX BY AGE BY EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT FOR THE POPULATION 18 YEARS AND OVER

#B15001 is the code that we would use for this

## Sex Broken up to Male, Female (2)
## AGE Broken up to 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-64, 65+, (5)
## Educational Attainment Broken up to less than diploma (no diploma), finish hs, Some college, associates, Bachelor, Graduate (6)

# AGE (Under 25, 25-44, 45-64, 65+   4 cases)
# Income (Less 10K, 10-15, 15-20, 20-25, 25-30, 30-35, etc)
