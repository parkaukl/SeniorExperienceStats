#PPNET
#Q385
# We had previously considered using PPEDUCAT, but this variable ended up not being helpful, and we felt that we could split this variable into a more interesting split of variables that aligned with the ACS

#This will just allow use to reform this data in a more helpful way, so that we don't need to worry about it. This is the 2016 Edition of this file

#Now We will need to clean the data. We will start off by removing the variables that are not useful to us. 

# I have observed the 2015 file of this data, in the Chicago Foreign Council. It phrases questions differently then the question that we have previously observed. Instead of looking at the same phrasing related to military intervention, it instead poses it as "Are you Pro or Anti Drone Strikes". This is a valuable question, no doubt, but it leaves our discussion open to survey bias. We cannot compare whether someone answers "How Effective do you think each of the following approaches are to achieving the foreign policy goals of the United States-Very Effective, somewhat,not very not at all" and "Drone Strikes against suspected terrorists in other countries". These evoke two different responses, and thus we cannot consider them equivalent. 

#However, the 2017 File does have these same measurements. Therefore, we should consider using this as our important variable. 

# There are some additional interesting variables that we can observe. Q 7_4a is really fascinating, about whether we should strive to create a strong military presense around the globe

#OTHER INTERESTING VARIABLES: ORLANDO, USR, MSC, CBSAMET. However, most of these are in the chicago Foreign Council 2016 File, but not the other

#Insert Here what data might be appropriate:

#We now need to look into the codebook to observe whether our response variables are coded similarly. 

#AGE appears to be coded in the same ways, as does Education, PPETHM,PPGENDER, XPHISPAN, Marital Status, Metropolitan Status, REgion, 

##PPINCIMP has more stratas in 2017, including more different classes for households that have more than 175 thousand in income.
